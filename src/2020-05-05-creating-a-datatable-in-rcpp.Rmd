### Introduction

`Rcpp` provides the `DataFrame` class which enables us to pass `data.frame` object between C++ and
R. `DataFrame` objects are key to R and used very widely.  They also provide the basis from which
two key packages extend them. One of these, the `tibble` package, operates in a similar fashion to
`data.table` and treats the data as _immutable_. Upon a change to the data, a new version is created
internally---this is frequently refered to as "copy-on-write". Immutable data structures have some
desirable properties in terms of reasoning with and about data, but the copying comes at a price in
terms of performance especially once data becomes sizeable.

The other package, `data.table`, offers a contrasting approach. It generally modifies the data
_in-place_; this is often referred to as _by reference_. As (generally) no copies of the data are
needed, the runtime is often reduced.  This design difference is (along with _a lot_ of attention to
performance and optimisations in general) one of the reasons why `data.table` is so [looking rather
attractive](https://h2oai.github.io/db-benchmark/) in benchmarks.

As objects of type `data.table` also inherit from `data.frame`, we can use all `data.frame`
functions on a `data.table`.  Internally, however, the two are very different.  The question now is,
how can we create a `data.table` efficiently inside of `Rcpp` without the need for a deep copy of
the data?

This question is important if the data generation process takes place in `C++`, _e.g._ when parsing, simulating, or otherwise generating data.
One example for which question came up is the [RITCH](https://github.com/DavZim/RITCH) package which
parses (large) binary ITCH files (financial messages) in `Rcpp` and needs a fast data conversion to `data.table`.

## Very Short Answer

To provide a very short answer, mostly for future reference (a more detailed answer is provided below):

- set the S3 class of the object to `"data.table", "data.frame"` in `Rcpp`

```{r, engine="Rcpp", eval=FALSE}
Rcpp::List create_data_table() {
  Rcpp::List res;
  
  // Populate the list
  // ...
  
  res.attr("class") = Rcpp::CharacterVector::create("data.table", "data.frame");
  return res;
}
```

- in R call the `data.table::setalloccol(df)` function on the "partial" `data.table`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
foo <- function() {
  dt <- create_data_table()
  dt <- data.table::setalloccol(dt)
  return(dt)
}
```
A look inside the `data.table::setalloccol()` functions shows that it itself calls only a few
`data.table` functions needed to do some housekeeping and optimisation on internal state. It would
be useful to access these functions directly from another package at the C level, and we plan to
discuss this with the `data.table` team.


## Detailed Answer

A first thought would be to use the `Rcpp::DataFrame` or the `Rcpp::List` class in `Rcpp` to return
the data to `R` and then call `data.table::setDT()` on the object to properly convert it to a
`data.table`.  To give an example, lets consider creating a dataset of some data in `Rcpp` and
returing it to R as a `Data.Frame`

```{r, engine="Rcpp"}
#include<Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
DataFrame simulate_data(int n = 10, int nobs = 10000) {
  // create a list with n slots
  List res(n);
  CharacterVector list_names = CharacterVector(n);
  
  // populate the list elements
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    list_names[i] = "col_" + std::to_string(i);
    res[i] = rnorm(nobs);
  }
  
  // set the names for the list elements
  res.names() = list_names;
  return res;
}
```

Using `setDT()`, we can convert the list to a `data.table`:

```{r}
create_dt_naive <- function(n = 10, nobs = 10000) {
  dt <- simulate_data(n, nobs)
  data.table::setDT(dt)
  return(dt)
}
set.seed(123)
dt <- create_dt_naive()
str(dt)
```

Inspecting the `data.table` code reveals, that internally, `data.table` uses the `setalloccol()` function to convert a `data.frame` to `data.table` after doing some checks.
This can be leveraged in the following way: 

Set the class attribute of the list to `"data.table", "data.frame"`

```{r, engine="Rcpp"}
#include<Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;
// [[Rcpp::export]]
List simulate_data_partial_dt(int n = 10, int nobs = 10000) {
  // create a list with n slots
  List res(n);
  CharacterVector list_names = CharacterVector(n);
  
  // populate the list elements
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    list_names[i] = "col_" + std::to_string(i);
    res[i] = rnorm(nobs);
  }
  res.names() = list_names;
  // Set the class attribute of the list
  res.attr("class") = CharacterVector::create("data.table", "data.frame");
  return res;
}
```

use `setalloccol()` to reallocate the data by reference
```{r}
create_dt_correct <- function(n = 10, nobs = 10000) {
  dt <- simulate_data_partial_dt(n, nobs)
  # reallocate the data.table by reference
  dt <- data.table::setalloccol(dt)
  return(dt)
}
set.seed(123)
dt2 <- create_dt_correct()
str(dt2)

all.equal(dt, dt2)
```

Comparing the two methods, we see that the correct implementation is a lot faster on smaller datasets.
On larger datasets, the differences is less dominant, which hints that `data.table` is able to use the data in place and has no need to copy it.

```{r}
# small dataset
rbenchmark::benchmark(
  create_dt_naive(15, 1e3),
  create_dt_correct(15, 1e3),
  replications = 10
)

# small dataset
rbenchmark::benchmark(
  create_dt_naive(15, 1e6),
  create_dt_correct(15, 1e6),
  replications = 10
)
```

TODO: R 4.0.0 brings a new function `list2DF()` which we should time as well.
