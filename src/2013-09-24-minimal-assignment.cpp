/**
 * _Munkres' Assignment Algorithm_ 
 * ([Munkres (1957)](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2098689?uid=3737864&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21102674250347),
 * also known as _hungarian algorithm_) is a well known algorithm 
 * in Operations Research solving the problem to optimally 
 * assign `N` jobs to `N` workers. 
 *
 * I needed to solve the _Minimal Assignment Problem_ for a 
 * relabeling algorithm in MCMC sampling for _finite mixture_
 * distributions, where I use a random permutation Gibbs 
 * sampler. For each sample an optimal labeling must be found,
 * i.e. I have `N` parameter vectors and must assign each vector
 * to one of the `N` components of the finite mixture under the restriction
 * that each component gets a parameter vector. For the assignment
 * of parameters to components 
 * [Stephens (1997b)] (http://www.isds.duke.edu/~scs/Courses/Stat376/Papers/Mixtures/LabelSwitchingStephensJRSSB.pdf) 
 * suggests an algorithm relying on the Minimal Assignment in regard
 * to a _loss matrix_. The labeling with the smallest loss is
 * then considered as optimal.
 *
 * After an unsuccessful search for libraries implementing 
 * the algorithm easily for C++ or C, I made the decision to
 * program it myself using `RcppArmadillo` for good performance. 
 * I found some guidance by the websites of 
 * [Bob Pilgrim](http://csclab.murraystate.edu/bob.pilgrim/445/munkres.html) and 
 * [TopCoder] (http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=tutorials&d2=hungarianAlgorithm).
 * These websites offer excellent tutorials to understand 
 * the algorithm and to convert it to code. The order of this 
 * implementation of Munkres' algorithm is of an order `N` to the power of 4. There exists
 * also a version of order `N` to the power of 3, but an order of `N` to the power of 4 works 
 * very good for me and coding time is as usual a critical factor
 * for me.
 *
 * In the following I walk through the different steps of
 * Munkres' algorithm and explain the main parts and their
 * functionality.
 *
 * Let's begin. The first step in Munkres' algorithm is to 
 * subtract the minimal element of each row from each element 
 * in this row.
