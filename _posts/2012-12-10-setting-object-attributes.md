All R objects have attributes, which can be queried and modified with the
`attr` method. Rcpp also provides a `names()` method for the commonly used
attribute: `attr("names")`. The following code snippet illustrates these
methods:


{% highlight cpp %}
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
NumericVector attribs() {
  NumericVector out = NumericVector::create(1, 2, 3);

  out.names() = CharacterVector::create("a", "b", "c");
  out.attr("my-attr") = "my-value";
  out.attr("class") = "my-class";

  return out;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's what the object we created in C++ looks like in R:

{% highlight r %}
attribs()
{% endhighlight %}



<pre class="output">
a b c 
1 2 3 
attr(,&quot;my-attr&quot;)
[1] &quot;my-value&quot;
attr(,&quot;class&quot;)
[1] &quot;my-class&quot;
</pre>
