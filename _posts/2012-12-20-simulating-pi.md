This example takes the standard simulation for the value of pi 
and in implements it in both R and C++. We will see that the C++ version 
is very similar to the R version.

We start with an R version. 

The basic idea is that for a point (x,y), we compute the distance to the origin
using Pythargoras' well-known expression, or in this context a standard distance 
norm. We do this repeatedly for a number of points, the ratio of those below one 
("inside the unit circle") to the number N of simulation will approach pi/4 -- as
we were filling the area of one quarter of the unit circle by limiting ourselves
the first quadrant (as we forced x and y to be between 0 and 1).

The key here is that we do this in a _vectorised_ way: by drawing
all N x and y coordinates, then computing all distances and comparing to 1.0. After
scaling up to the full circle, we have an estimate of pi.



{% highlight r %}
piR <- function(N) {
    x <- runif(N)
    y <- runif(N)
    d <- sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
    return(4 * sum(d < 1.0) / N)
}

set.seed(5)
c(piR(1000), piR(10000), piR(100000), piR(1000000))
{% endhighlight %}

</pre>

The neat thing about Rcpp sugar enables us to write C++ code that
looks almost as compact.  

{% highlight cpp %}
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
double piSugar(const int N) {
    NumericVector x = runif(N);
    NumericVector y = runif(N);
    NumericVector d = sqrt(x*x + y*y);
    return 4.0 * sum(d < 1.0) / N;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Apart from using types (hey, this is C++) and assuring the RNG gets
set and reset, the code is essentially identical.

And by using the same RNG, so are the results. Rcpp ensures that
the RNG state is set and reset properly by instantiating an object 
of class `RNGScope`. 

{% highlight r %}
set.seed(5)
c(piSugar(1000), piSugar(10000), piSugar(100000), piSugar(1000000))
{% endhighlight %}
